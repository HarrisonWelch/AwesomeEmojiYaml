## loadSlackEmojis.bat

This repository has a tool for mass uploading emojis to a slack server.

This uses the npm package `emojipacks` where it can upload to a slack server/workspace.

You'll need to globally (don't worry this README says its okay) install the `emojipacks` with the command

```shell
npm i -g emojipacks
```

Afterwords run the batch script

```
loadSlackEmojis.bat
```

## files_to_yaml.py

This repository also has a Python 3 builder for a yaml file full of emojis

```shell
python files_to_yaml.py
```
